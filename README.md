# react-portal-component

**Not yet, coming soon**

## What should it do?

- [ ] transfer your tree to a subtree at the end of the body or a parent specified
- [ ] clean up DOM after it is unmounted
- [ ] shouldn't have any state per se, I want to make it simple
- [ ] provide children with the ability to close the portal
- [ ] style, customization?
